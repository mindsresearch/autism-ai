	abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) systems shift to interact with new domains and populations, so does {AI} ethics: a relatively nascent subdiscipline that frequently concerns itself with questions of “fairness” and “accountability.” This fairness-centred approach has been criticized for (amongst other things) lacking the ability to address discursive, rather than distributional, injustices. In this paper I simultaneously validate these concerns, and work to correct the relative silence of both conventional and critical {AI} ethicists around disability, by exploring the narratives deployed by {AI} researchers in discussing and designing systems around autism. Demonstrating that these narratives frequently perpetuate a dangerously dehumanizing model of autistic people, I explore the material consequences this might have. More importantly, I highlight the ways in which discursive harms—particularly discursive harms around dehumanization—are not simply inadequately handled by conventional {AI} ethics approaches, but actively invisible to them. I urge {AI} ethicists to critically and immediately begin grappling with the likely consequences of an approach to ethics which focuses on personhood and agency, in a world in which many populations are treated as having neither. I suggest that this issue requires a substantial revisiting of the underlying premises of {AI} ethics, and point to some possible directions in which researchers and practitioners might look for inspiration.},

              Lay abstract
              Camouflaging in autism spectrum disorder refers to behaviors and/or strategies that mask the presentation of autism spectrum disorder features in social contexts in order to appear “non-autistic” (Attwood, 2007). Camouflaging modifies the behavioral presentation of core autism spectrum disorder features (e.g. social and communication differences), but the underlying autistic profile is unaffected, yielding a mismatch between external observable features and the internal lived experience of autism. Camouflaging could be an important factor in later diagnosis of individuals without co-occurring intellectual disability, especially among those designated female sex at birth. Little research to date has examined how gender identity impacts camouflaging, however. Furthermore, no study has compared groups that differ in diagnostic timing to directly investigate if later-diagnosed individuals show elevated camouflaging relative to those receiving an earlier diagnosis. We used the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire subscales (Assimilation, Compensation, and Masking) and investigated the roles of sex, gender identity (gender diverse vs cisgender), and diagnostic timing (childhood/adolescent-diagnosed vs adult-diagnosed), and the interactions of these factors, in autistic adults ( N = 502; ages 18–49 years). Main effects of sex, gender identity, and diagnostic timing were revealed. Autistic females reported more camouflaging across all three Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire subscales compared to males. Gender diverse adults reported elevated camouflaging on the Compensation subscale compared to cisgender adults. Adulthood-diagnosed individuals reported elevated Assimilation and Compensation compared to childhood/adolescence-diagnosed individuals. We discuss how the aspects of camouflaging may have unique implications for later diagnostic timing and for the intersection of neurodiversity and gender diversity.},

While the former (Kanner's syndrome) has become the widely known focus of intensive investigation, the latter (Asperger's syndrome) did not receive the attention it deserves. Often the two conditions mistakenly have been thought to be identical. This paper tries (a) to assign to autistic psychopathy a definite place in psychiatric nosology and (b) to delineate sharply the differences between the essential characteristics of it and of early infantile autism. The author (who was the first European child psychiatrist to publish a case of early infantile autism) reports briefly a case of his own observation-the occurrence of Kanner's and Asperger's syndrome in one each of two members of the same family.},

	abstract = {Radiomics with deep learning models have become popular in computer-aided diagnosis and have outperformed human experts on many clinical tasks. Specifically, radiomic models based on artificial intelligence ({AI}) are using medical data (i.e., images, molecular data, clinical variables, etc.) for predicting clinical tasks such as autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}). In this review, we summarized and discussed the radiomic techniques used for {ASD} analysis. Currently, the limited radiomic work of {ASD} is related to the variation of morphological features of brain thickness that is different from texture analysis. These techniques are based on imaging shape features that can be used with predictive models for predicting {ASD}. This review explores the progress of {ASD}-based radiomics with a brief description of {ASD} and the current non-invasive technique used to classify between {ASD} and healthy control ({HC}) subjects. With {AI}, new radiomic models using the deep learning techniques will be also described. To consider the texture analysis with deep {CNNs}, more investigations are suggested to be integrated with additional validation steps on various {MRI} sites.},

Currently, ASD affects 1 in 59 individuals and can be a costly disorder across one's lifetime. Because of the prevalence, costs, and range of behavioral needs, early intervention is vital to teach skills across a variety of domains and prevent the development or exacerbation of behavioral deficits and excesses. Interventions based on applied behavior analysis have the most empirical support; several strategies to teach social skills, communication, and adaptive skills are discussed.},
